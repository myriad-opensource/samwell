Module Contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The module contains the following public classes:

    - :class:`~samwell.overlap_detector.Interval` -- Represents a region mapping to the genome
        that is 0-based and open-ended
    - :class:`~samwell.overlap_detector.OverlapDetector` -- Detects and returns overlaps between
        a set of genomic regions and another genomic region
